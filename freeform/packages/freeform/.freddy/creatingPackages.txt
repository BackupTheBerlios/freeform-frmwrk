<b>Creating your own packages</b><br />
Since the Freeform Framework relies on packages and automatically loads classes from them 
(yes, forget the nasty includes!), there are several conventions:
<ol>
<li>All PHP classes are kept in separate files named exactly as the classes with the '.php5'
extension. Note that case also matters!</li>
<li>All packages are kept in the 'packages' folder of Freeform home folder.</li>
<li>The Freeform home folder may not be accessible for users via web (i.e, it can lie outside
the web document root directory).</li>
<li>The loader file (index.php5) must reside in the web server document root.</li>
</ol>
You create packages by creating directories under the 'packages' directory
under the Freeform home directory. You place class files that belong to the
package into that directory, together with the '.config' and '.spi' files.
The resources are placed into the 'resources' directory of each package. For 
example, if you want to create the 'mypackage' package, the directory tree
will look like:

<pre>
c:/
  |-freeform/
    |-packages/
    | |-freeform/
    | |-html/
    | |-mypackage/
    | | |-resources/
    | | | |-MyAction.html
    | | |-MyAction.php5
    |-rtl.php5
</pre>

(other packages directories are collapsed or omitted). Package resources can be 
split into subdirectories under the 'resources' directory. To access
them simply add the subdirectory name before the resource file name in a call to 
<method>Package::getResourcePath</method>() method.
