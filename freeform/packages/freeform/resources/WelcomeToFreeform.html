    <h2>Welcome to Freeform Framework</h2>

      If you see this page it means that the Freeform Framework has been successfully installed

      application at this web site.

    <p>
      Freeform Framework is a web application development framework aimed at creating scalable web 
      apllications. It is not just another MVC framework, it adresses a wider range of common problems
      web developers face while creating large-scale web applications.

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <small>The core features of Freeform Framework are:</small>
    <ol>
    <li>
    The <b>MVC approach</b> that separates business logic from presentation logic. In Freeform, it is impossible
    to write business logic code that will generate resulting HTML directly. The bundled <package>html</package>
    package that implements the best templating engine in PHP5 world, while allowing you to 
    stick small PHP code fragments, discourages this and is truly XML-based. With its tools you can
    create your own tags that will present complex content and separate the business logic from the
    presentation logic. The template designers will never have to type endless URLs and select lists
    or take care of not destroying some parts of embedded PHP code, while the programmers can concentrate
    on code manageability because their code is free from any markup.
    </li><li>
    The framework also offers an elegant <b>form processing</b> automation solution. All you have to do now is to create a form
    class and add fields to it, specifying validators. Upon submission the form will validate itself, and, if it fails,
    you can redisplay the page where wrong input will be re-prompted saving the correct input. File uploads are also
    fully automated; you can validate upload correctedness with no coding at all.
    </li><li> 
    <b>Packages</b> is a solution to application modularity. With Freeform, it is 
    easy to create separate packages, or modules, that solve some common sub-application problems 
    (a forum, for instance). Using its own configuration the package can easy plug into your existing application in 
    seconds with no additional programming. You will just have to modify several configuration setting and you are done!
    </li><li>
    <b>Session API</b> is a new approach to handling sessions and users. It unifies interface to sessions while giving you
    the ability to choose from many underlying implementations. Thus, the packages are unaware from all session and user          
    handling tricks. Unified user handling guarantees that whatever user model your application has, other packages will
    be sure that there is a current user and what role he has.
    </li><li>
    <b>Security API</b> is a standard way to protect critical areas of your application from unauthorized access. Each user
    action is checked against a security policy that makes decisions on whether the request can be completed 
    in the current environment.
    You can then configure other packages to use your security policies to protect access to them. Besides,
    the user system is role-based, where you define the roles and instruct other packages which roles to allow or to
    deny. Being that simple, you can easily define your custom and reusable security policies for the entire application.
