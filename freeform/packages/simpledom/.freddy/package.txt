/**
This package consists of classes that constitute the SimpleDOM API. It
allows you to parse well-formed XML documents to produce DOM-like trees
that consist of elements, text nodes and processing instructions.
You can also create custom parsers to create element trees where elements
are represented by objects of different classes to provide some additional
functionality on the parsed data.
