<b>Util Package Overview</b>

This package is a helper package and contains different utility classes and interfaces. 
They do not rely on other Freeform packages and can be used even in non-freeform
applications. 

<b>Here is a brief description of the most important classes of this package:</b>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>interface <class>Iterable</class></b><br />
    This is a basic interface that represents a collection of items that can be 
    iterated over. It declares two methods, <tt>hasMore()</tt> and <tt>getNext()</tt>,
    that are used to test if there are more items available and fetch next item and
    advance to the next item. Note that this interface has no connection to the SPL
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>interface <class>PaginatedIterable</class></b><br />
    This interface extends Iterable and provides additional methods to access the iterable's
    items trough pages. You will be dealing with instances of this interface when
    you obtain result sets form database query in the SQL package. The <class>HTMLShowIterable</class>
    and <class>HTMLShowPagination</class> tags from the HTML package utilize paginatedIterable's methods
    to automatically show repeated paginated content
  </li>

  <li>
    <b><class>Validator</class></b><br />
    This is an abstract class with just one method, <tt>isValid()</tt>. The purpose of this
    class is to unify arbitrary values validation by applications that collect
    input and pass them over to other applications not knowing the nature of the
    data collected. For example, <class>InputField</class>s actively employ validators to check the validity
    of user-submitted data.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b><class>NoMoreElementsException</class>, <class>ConfigurationException</class></b><br />
    These two exceptions are thrown when <class>Iterable</class> attempts to read past end 
    of iterated over entity in its <tt>getNext()</tt> method and when 
    certain package detects that it has not been properly configured.
  </li>
</ul>
