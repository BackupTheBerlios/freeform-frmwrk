  <h2>Caching Demo</h2>
  Since version 1.2.0 Freeform framework supports powerful caching API that lets you to
  easily control the caches of the prowser as well as on the server. This page contains the
  time of its creation; the page's life time is set to 10 seconds. Clicking on the link to refresh the page (below) will NOT cause the reload of this page from the server; you will notice that the time
  will not change. Also, if you have enabled server-side caching, you can open another 
  browser and load the same URL (copy and paste it) - you will see that the page contains the
  same generation time.<br/><br/>
  Also the HTML package supports the parser cache - the parsed templates are stored on the
  server and quickly unserialized on subsequent requests to the same template file. 
  This cache is fully automatic - you have only to enable it in the configuration of the
  HTML package. The cache will detect any changes you made to the template files and 
  refresh itself as needed.<br/><br/>
