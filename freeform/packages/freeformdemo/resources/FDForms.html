  <h2>Forms Demo</h2>
  Freeform Framework greatly simplifies form handling. It uses special <tt>Form</tt> class to
  abstract the input form, its fields and processing action. The form fields are special classes
  that can validate themselves. Besides, the HTML package will automatically display warning
  messages for you if the form has been filled with mistakes, and will take care of setting
  the field values - so that the page designers will not have to worry about the action attribute
  of the form and about inserting the field values manually. The encapsulation of an input
  form into a separate class gives you the power of having multiple forms on the same page
  as well as having same form on multiple pages. Page designer can even create a separate
  template for the form and include it on every page that will have that form!<br/><br/>
  
  <!-- If the form is correctly displayed, we will show a message only -->
  <HTMLIfSet key="success">
    <div style="width: 100%; border-color: green; border-style: solid; background-color: WhiteSmoke">
    <b>Thank you!</b><br/><br/>
    You have successfully filled the form. Please note that this page was generated with the same 
    action that the form. You can now go <HTMLLink action="FDForms">back</HTMLLink>. </div>
  </HTMLIfSet>
  
  <!-- This tag will prevent the display of the form if it was correctly filled -->
  <HTMLIfNotSet key="success">
  Here is a sample form:<br/><br/>
  
  <!-- This tag opens the form, writes correct action and method attribute and extracts field
       objects into the template variables -->
  <HTMLShowForm key="form">
    
    <!-- This tag will enable display of the contained fragment if the form was filled 
         incorrectly -->
    <HTMLIfInputFieldErrors key="form">
    <div style="width: 100%; border-color: red; border-style: solid; background-color: WhiteSmoke">
    <b>One or more errors occured:</b>

      <tr>

        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

          <input type="submit" value=" Go "/><br/>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </HTMLShowForm><br/>
  
  You can test the form by trying to enter bad values: first try to enter all values incorrectly,
  then enter one field correctly and so on. You will see the form save correct input (try switching
  the radio buttons and checking the box between incorrect submissions). Also note that the
  list of errors will also change. Please use the 'View Source' and 'View Template' links above
  to see how easy to make the template and to build the form.<br/><br/>
  
  In general, you will need to construct a <tt>Form</tt> object, add fields to it and display it.
  You dipslay a form very much like you did with simple HTML forms, but replacing the 
  <tt>form</tt> and <tt>input</tt> tags with their <tt>HTMLShowForm</tt> and <tt>HTMLInput</tt>
  counterparts. The <tt>HTMLIfInputFieldErrors</tt> and <tt>HTMLIfInputFieldError</tt> tags
  are conditional tags that will display their contents only if form fields were incorrectly
  filled.
