  <h2>Repeatable and Conditional Display Demo</h2>
  Freeform offers a very easy way of showing complicated repeatable content. This demo shows
  you how to display the contents of a simple array, very similar to a result set from
  a database query (please see the source and the template of this demo)<br/><br/>
  
  <div style="border-style: solid; border-color: Gray; background-color: WhiteSmoke"> 
    <!-- This tag will iterate through the array of widgets. Since it is a 2-dimensional 
         array, the keys of the second dimension will be extracted as variables to the template -
         note how we access every key -->
    <HTMLShowIterable key="widgets">
      <!-- This tag, if used within the HTMLShowIterable, will display its content if the iterable
           was initially empty --> 
      <ifempty>Sorry, we have no widgets</ifempty>
      <!-- This tag, if used within the HTMLShowIterable, will display its content if the iterable
           was not empty --> 
      <ifnotempty><i>Our Widgets:</i><br /></ifnotempty>
      Product Title: {%title}<br />
      Product Description: {%desc}<br />
      Product Price: <b>{%price}</b>
      <!-- This tag when used within the HTMLShowIterable, holds the separator that will
           be repeated if there are more entries in the iterable, after each iteration -->
      <separator><br /><br /></separator>
    </HTMLShowIterable>
  </div><br/><br/>
  
  The following section is displayed since we do not have any gismos 
  (there is no template variable 'gismos'): <br/><br/>
  
  <!-- This tag will enable the display of its content if there is no template variable
       'gismos'. -->
  <HTMLIfNotSet key="gismos">
    <div style="border-style: solid; border-color: Red; background-color: WhiteSmoke"> 
      <b>Sorry, we do not have gismos</b><br/><br/>
      We are currently out of gismos, please visit us later. Thank you!
    </div>
  </HTMLIfNotSet><br/><br/>
  
  Next we display two different lists that have the same data layout. For that purpose we will
  use the region - a piece of the template that can be reused elsewhere in the template.<br/><br/>
  
  This is how our region will look like:<br/><br/>
   
  <div style="border-style: solid; border-color: Green; background-color: WhiteSmoke"> 
    <!-- This tag defines the actual region. Note we also place the variables here.
         We enforce the 'show' attribute of the tag to show the actual content 
         in this place. -->
    <HTMLRegion name="product" show="true">
      <i>Product Title</i>: {%title}<br />
      <i>Product Description</i>: {%desc}<br />
      <i>Product Price</i>: <b>{%price}</b>
    </HTMLRegion>
  </div><br/><br/>
  
  You see the product title set to the title of the page since there currently is a variable
  of name 'title' - the title of the page. It is a feature of the HTML package that allows you
  to nest variables in different scopes of visibility. Below you will see the lists generated
  with the above region and with correct product names (please see the template and the source 
  again):<br/><br/>
  
  <!-- First list -->
  <div style="border-style: solid; border-color: Gray; background-color: WhiteSmoke"> 
    <HTMLShowIterable key="widgets1">
      <ifnotempty><i>The Widgets:</i><br/></ifnotempty>
      <!-- Since we could not define the ifempty and separator tags in the region
           itself, we had to repeat them here. HTMLShowRegion actually shows the
           declared region. The region is referenced by its name -->
      <HTMLShowRegion name="product"/>
      <separator><br /><br /></separator>
    </HTMLShowIterable>
  </div><br/><br/>
  
  <!-- Second list - note it uses the same region -->
  <div style="border-style: solid; border-color: Gray; background-color: WhiteSmoke"> 
    <HTMLShowIterable key="gadgets">
      <ifnotempty><i>The Gadgets:</i><br/></ifnotempty>
      <HTMLShowRegion name="product"/>
      <separator><br /><br /></separator>
    </HTMLShowIterable>
  </div><br/><br/>
  
  
  Now you can compare the size of the source to estimate how much your time is saved to
  display this content. The template is also very easy to design - it contains more
  explanations and comments than the actual markup. However, you were able to produce
  a fairly complex page with simple steps - and you have the option to freely change the
  look and feel of the template just in minutes, without having to change the PHP source code.
