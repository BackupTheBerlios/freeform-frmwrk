  <h2>Processing Instructions Demo</h2>
  Since version 1.1.1 Freeform framework allows you to embed PHP code into the templates.
  The code is executed every time the document processor reaches it; the code has read only
  access to the template variables so that it can use them. The code should output valid
  markup with the help of the echo or print statements; you cannot mix markup and PHP code in 
  a single instruction.<br/><br/>
  This demo takes a list of names and uses PHP code in the template to reverse them:<br/><br/>
  
  <?php
    while($values->hasMore()) {
      $v = $values->getNext();
      echo $v, ' : ', strrev($v), "<br/>\r\n";
    }
  ?>
