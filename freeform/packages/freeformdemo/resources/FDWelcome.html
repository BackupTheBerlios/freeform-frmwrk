  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  This is a demo collection of some most frequently used Freeform features. You can navigate 
  thru the demos using the 'previous' and 'next' links at the bottom of each page, or by using
  the quick jump form at the top left of each page.<br/><br/>
  
  These are just basic demos of the tools offered to you by the core Freeform packages, notably
  by the HTML package. Sources and templates used by each demo can be reached by clicking
  the 'View Source' and 'View Template' links in the top right corner of every page. They
  will help you understand how to write web applications with Freeform. The code and
  the templates have rich comments to help you understand what each part means.<br/><br/>
  
  Please note that you will need to have PHP5.0.4 installed. If you have older version, you 
  still will be able to view the demos, but since the XML parsing is broken in versions
  prior to 5.0.4, you will see template comments and/or HTML entities on the resulting pages.
  Also, if you use Free18n as the i18n API provider, you will need to have PHP version 5.1.0
  or above.<br/><br/>
  
  It is also highly advisable that you have Freddy package installed. Freeform 1.1.1 comes 
  with rich documentation, so you will use Freddy to read it to better understand how to use
  Freeform features.
