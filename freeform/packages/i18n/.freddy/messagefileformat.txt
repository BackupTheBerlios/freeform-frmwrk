<b>Message File Format</b>

The format of the messages file is very straightforward, you can create it with
any UTF-8 enabled editor (like Zend Studio). Here is an example of such file:

<tt>
[en_Official]<br/>
hello="Hello!"

[en_American]<br/>
hello="Hi!"

[es_Official]<br/>
hello="Â¡Hola!"
</tt>

The file consists of several sections labeled in form lc_dc (language code, the underscore
and the dialect code).
